## Abstract
Grammatical errors are common in text written by non-native English speakers and can negatively impact clarity and professionalism. This project presents an automatic grammar correction system based on deep learning sequence-to-sequence models. The model detects and corrects grammatical errors such as tense inconsistencies, subject–verb agreement errors, missing articles, and incorrect word usage. The system is designed to generate fluent and grammatically correct sentences suitable for real-world applications.

## Our Improvement Over Existing Paper
- Used transformer-based encoder–decoder architecture
- Enhanced copy mechanism for better handling of unchanged tokens
- Improved preprocessing for noisy learner-written text
- Achieved improved fluency and correction accuracy
